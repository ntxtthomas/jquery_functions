# jquery_functions

This is a basic refresher excercise to familiarize with the jQuery API. I've done this excericise a couple of times in the past already but wanted to do it again as a refresher AND to incorporate;

Bootstrap
Responsive Web Design
Font Awesome

...along with;  
HTML
CSS
jQuery

This was 90% easy and intuitive but ran into a couple of typical issues; 

LEARNING OPPORTUNITY
git mistake.. I had manually created a READ.me and forgot to git pull before my next git push. This lead me to an error reporting section in terminal and sort of in a limbo state. I did have the message;
"Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge was necessary..."
The problem is that there was no command prompt and I had no idea what to do. I researched and discovered the solution; 
press "i"
write your merge message
press "esc"
write ":wq"
then press enter

The READ.me file got picked up and so I git commit and was all set. 

Aside from that I'm just going over how Responsive works in Bootstrap. Got the grid system down ok, haven't hit Media Queries or Typography yet.. but its coming. 

Now going to commit changes and git pull :-)

LEARNING OPPORTUNITY
Using Boostrap on Navbar.. when in mobile size the navBar toggles to a "hamburger" but was not working at after that. Did much research, tried many things.. in the end I loaded jQuery before Bootstrap, worked. Lots of time on that one. 

Update: Did lots of cleanup on the layout.. looking better, but now the navBar toggle isn't working again.. going to bed
Update: updated jQuery CDN to more current version and again loaded before bootstrap.. success, navBar toggle works.. on to Breakpoints,.. I'd also like to minimize the jQuery Function list and add other Bootstrap examples such as Table and Forms.
